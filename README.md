# the-bulletin-board
i wish to make a website that host almost every thing as life as become a online mess using peaces of every other site or app i just wish to bring it all together 

**The Bulletin Board** is to keep everything together & in your control of the public with site back end open and easy to share builds or ideas in one place becouse just others said in the past linux terminal scary so why not make it freindly like linux is starting to thanks to @ValveSoftware & the community's
>ill start with using a website maker like wix to get an example, then learn html or something like it to make a proper start

ill share what im up to here and on my twitter so people can see what im on-about
